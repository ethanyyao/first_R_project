```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
# Load the data
First, we are going to use read.csv to load the gapminder data.

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv")
summary(dat)
```

# Plot the data

## Setup
We need to load the ggplot2 package:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

## Plotting

This is R code to make a plot:
```{r}
ggplot(data = dat,
       mapping = aes(x = year,
                     y = lifeExp,
                     by = country,
                     color = continent)) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw()
```

## Insert pre-made figure

We have a figure at "figures/life_exp.png". How do we insert it into our report?

```{r, fig.cap = "Life Expectancy vs. Year, for each country, facetted by continent"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/life_exp.png")
```
